## About myself

I decided to change my profesion and so I ended QA courses. Some mounthes I worked in this sphere and understud that I want to create sites instead of testing it. So now I learn frontend by myself and I like it. 

I like to solve hard tasks, it gives me a lot of energy and good mood. I realize that to get success I need to work hard and to study all the time, but I am a curious person and I like to learn something new every day. 

I was a journalist, so I have an experience in researching information and to work with a big amount of data. I have a deep understanding that if I take the job, I do it productively. I don't afraid of challenges and I am convinced that the challenges make us better. Even if I lose, I can work on my mistakes and go ahead to reach new "mountains". The world and technology don't stop in development, so I will not. I am sure that I need to develop and improve myself all the time.
